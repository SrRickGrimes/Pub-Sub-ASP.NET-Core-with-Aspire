# Building a Modern Loan Management System with Event-Driven Architecture in .NET

### High-Level Architecture Overview

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Client Layer"
        C1[Web Client]
        C2[Mobile Client]
    end

    subgraph "API Layer"
        A1[Loan API]
        A2[BFF Service]
    end

    subgraph "Domain Layer"
        D1[Loan Domain]
        D2[Events]
    end

    subgraph "Infrastructure Layer"
        DB[(SQL Server)]
        MQ[RabbitMQ]
    end

    C1 & C2 --> A1 & A2
    A1 --> D1
    D1 --> D2
    D2 --> MQ
    A1 --> DB
    MQ --> A2
    A2 --> C1 & C2
```

### Event Flow Architecture

```mermaid

    participant Client
    participant API as Loan API
    participant Domain as Domain Layer
    participant DB as SQL Server
    participant MQ as RabbitMQ
    participant BFF as BFF Service

    Client->>API: Create Loan Request
    API->>Domain: Validate & Process
    Domain->>DB: Begin Transaction
    DB-->>Domain: Transaction Started
    Domain->>DB: Save Loan Entity
    Domain->>DB: Save LoanSubmittedEvent
    DB-->>Domain: Save Confirmed
    Domain->>MQ: Publish LoanSubmittedEvent
    Domain->>DB: Commit Transaction
    DB-->>API: Transaction Committed
    API-->>Client: Loan Created Response
    MQ->>BFF: Process LoanSubmittedEvent
    BFF->>Client: Real-time Update
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Components

#### Loan API Controller
```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class LoansController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<ActionResult<CreateLoanResponse>> CreateLoan(CreateLoanRequest request)
    {
        // Validation and business logic
        var loanId = $"LOAN-{DateTime.UtcNow:yyyyMMdd}-{Guid.NewGuid().ToString("N")[..8]}";
        
        // Create and save loan entity
        var loan = new LoanEntity
        {
            Id = loanId,
            CustomerId = request.CustomerId,
            Amount = request.Amount,
            Status = LoanStatus.Submitted
        };

        // Create and save event
        var submittedEvent = new LoanSubmittedEvent
        {
            LoanId = loan.Id,
            Amount = request.Amount,
            CustomerId = request.CustomerId
        };

        // Save and publish
        await SaveAndPublishAsync(loan, submittedEvent);
        
        return Ok(new CreateLoanResponse { LoanId = loan.Id });
    }
}
```

#### Domain Model

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class LoanEntity {
        +string Id
        +string CustomerId
        +decimal Amount
        +LoanStatus Status
        +DateTime CreatedAt
    }

    class LoanEvent {
        +string Id
        +string LoanId
        +string EventType
        +DateTime Timestamp
    }

    class LoanSubmittedEvent {
        +string CustomerId
        +decimal Amount
    }

    LoanEvent <|-- LoanSubmittedEvent
    LoanEntity "1" --> "*" LoanEvent
```

#### BFF Consumer
```csharp
public class LoanSubmittedConsumer : IConsumer<LoanSubmittedIntegrationEvent>
{
    private readonly ILogger<LoanSubmittedConsumer> _logger;

    public async Task Consume(ConsumeContext<LoanSubmittedIntegrationEvent> context)
    {
        var message = context.Message;
        _logger.LogInformation("Processing loan submission: {LoanId}", message.LoanId);
        
        // Process the event and update clients
        await ProcessLoanSubmissionAsync(message);
    }
}
```

### 2. Infrastructure Setup

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Infrastructure"
        SQL[(SQL Server)]
        RMQ[RabbitMQ]
    end

    subgraph "Services"
        API[Loan API]
        BFF[BFF Service]
    end

    SQL -.->|Data| API
    RMQ -.->|Messages| API
    RMQ -.->|Messages| BFF
```

## Technical Implementation Highlights

### 1. Database Design
```sql
CREATE TABLE Loans (
    Id NVARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerId NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Amount DECIMAL(18,2) NOT NULL,
    Status NVARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    CreatedAt DATETIME2 NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE LoanEvents (
    Id NVARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    LoanId NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    EventType NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Data NVARCHAR(MAX) NOT NULL,
    Timestamp DATETIME2 NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (LoanId) REFERENCES Loans(Id)
);
```

### 2. Message Integration
```csharp
builder.Services.AddMassTransit(x =>
{
    x.UsingRabbitMq((context, cfg) =>
    {
        cfg.Host(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("messaging"));
        cfg.UseMessageRetry(r => r.Intervals(100, 200, 500, 800, 1000));
    });
});
```

# Start infrastructure
docker-compose up -d

# Run migrations
dotnet ef database update

# Start services
dotnet run --project src/Bank.Loan.Api
dotnet run --project src/Bank.Loan.Bff
```

### 2. Production Deployment
